# access-classifier

Preprocessing and modeling scripts for Carleton University DATA 500 course project. Project objectives are to develop a CNN classifer for predicting whether an image is "accessible" or "inaccessible".

In 2019, the federal government initiated Accessibility Standards Canada to prioritize a barrier free Canada by 2040, however, there are data gaps on the infrastructure that make the built-environment inaccessible for the 9.6% of people (over 15 years-old) who have mobility disabilities in Canada. Thus, this project leverages open source crowdsourced street-level images and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to test a hybridized approach for classifying whether a building’s entrance is accessible or not. Since identifying the various barriers that impeded those who face a diversity of mobility restrictions is complex, this research seeks to support a small piece of this puzzle, defining “accessible” building entrances as building doors that are connected to an accessible exterior pathway. Therefore, we seek to answer: Can CNNs trained on open source imagery, from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, yield accurate results when applied to classify the accessibility of building entrances broadly?
